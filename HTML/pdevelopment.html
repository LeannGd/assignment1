	<h2 style = "color:black;font-size:160%";>Summary</h2> 

	<p style = "color:black;font-size:110%";>“Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener touched on very important topics. The 
	chapters that we were advised to read was of great importance <br>because it encouraged me to be serious about making goals and 
	the road to achieve them. After reading those chapters I became inclined to tweak the goals I had written </br>down for the 
	new year and make them more realistic and in order. The chapters highlighted that the journey and process is not as easy as it
	is portrayed, and it takes <br>dedication and discipline.The authors also added wise words which I made note of because sometimes 
	us young adults we discouraged easily or procrastinatewithout realising that a result of our actions will push back our goals.</br></p>
