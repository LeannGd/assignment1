	  <p style= "color:black;font-size:130%">Below shows results of the personality test taken on <b>Keirsey</b>.
	   This test was valid in my opinion.<br>The keywords such as <mark>factual,dependable and steady</mark> were excellent 
	   words used to describe myself.</br>Characteristic traits such as <mark>loyal mate<mark/> was indeed factual. The test 
	   also expressed that I know when <br>to have fun with friends and when to settle and get tasks completed.
	   The test had a accuracy of 80% due </br>to the results being similar to what I knew about myself and has 
	   been informed about. </p>
